# E-Commerce_BackEnd

for this homework assignment we were tasked with building the back end for an e-commerce site.

We will be doing this by using our skills learned in class with Sequelize and MySql as well as using Postman or Insomnia to record our video for submission to show that our back end application works propperly.
